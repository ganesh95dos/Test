deploy EKS

Ensure EKS Node IAM Role Allows ELB Access

Go to AWS Console → IAM → Roles → Find the EKS node instance role (the one attached to the SPOT instances).

Ensure it has the following Amazon-managed policy attached:

    AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy

    AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly

    AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy

    ElasticLoadBalancingFullAccess ✅

Check LoadBalancer
kubectl get deployment -n kube-system

NAME                                         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
aws-load-balancer-controller                1/1     1            1           5d

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
kubectl get crds | grep ingress

Option 2: Modify Node Group to Attach Only One Tagged SG (via Terraform)

If you're managing everything via Terraform and want a permanent fix, update your config so only one of the security groups is tagged.

You can:

    Set cluster_primary_security_group_tags = {} or disable attach_cluster_primary_security_group

    Ensure only one SG (node group SG) has the tag

But for now, console fix is faster.
